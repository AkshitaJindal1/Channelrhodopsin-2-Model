We used genetic algorithms from the DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) library to fit a model to experimental data. 

Here, the files computeresidual.py and gafitting.py are for single photocurrent acquired at light intensity (10 V). The files computeresidual_all.py and ga_fitting_all.py are for all photocurrents acquired from a light protocol with increasing intensity (2 V, 4 V, 6 V, 8V, 10 V).
