Modelling and calibrating the kinetics of Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) 

Poster Abstract:

Advances in optical manipulation and observation of neural activity has paved the way for widespread application of closed-loop systems for real-time optical control of neural circuit dynamics. Closing the loop optogenetically is a powerful approach for investigation of neural state changes such as synchronisation and plasticity. In particular, the closed-loop manipulation of neuronal networks on physiologically relevant timescales provides invaluable insights into how network structures shapes network dynamics. Inspired by the dynamic clamp technique, the present study combines mathematical modelling and all-optical electrophysiology to provide closed-loop, real-time feedback control to the network of neurons. By bridging a gap between experimental recordings and theoretical models, this approach will also enable us to directly test model predictions to validate and confirm their accuracy. Moreover, the closed-loop optogenetic control of network dynamics provide means to reversibly modify network activity with high spatiotemporal resolution. This will allow us to explore novel treatments for pathological states such as the excessive network synchronisation associated with epilepsy or changes in synaptic plasticity associated with Parkinsonâ€™s disease. Overall, this study highlights the ability of the system to conduct activity-guided closed-loop optogenetic experimentation as a new paradigm to study network dynamics.
